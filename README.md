# CRYPTO
I've created this application as a side-project while studying "computer security" subject as a cs student.

the app can be considered as a reference for cryptography algorithms.

cryptography algorithms are built in javascript.

Available Algorithms so far:

* Caesar algorithm

* Monoalphabetic

* Vigenere

* Playfair

* Row Transposition

* Railfence

* RC5

* RC6

feel free to add more cryptography algorithms in any language.
