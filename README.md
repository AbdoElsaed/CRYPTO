# CRYPTO
I've created this application as a side-project while studying "Computer Security" subject as a CS student.

The app can be considered as a reference for cryptography algorithms.

Included cryptography algorithms are built in JavaScript.

### Available algorithms so far:

* Caesar

* Monoalphabetic

* Vigenere

* Playfair

* Row Transposition

* Railfence

* RC5

* RC6

feel free to add more cryptography algorithms in any language.
