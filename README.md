# CRYPTO
I've created this Application as a Side-Project while studying "Computer Security" Subject as a CS Student.

The App can be considered as a Reference for Cryptography Algorithms.

Included Cryptography Algorithms are built in JavaScript.

Available Algorithms so far:

* Caesar algorithm

* Monoalphabetic

* Vigenere

* Playfair

* Row Transposition

* Railfence

* RC5

* RC6

feel free to add more cryptography algorithms in any language.
